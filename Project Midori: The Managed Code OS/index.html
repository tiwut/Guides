        <h1>Project Midori: The Non-Windows Dream</h1>
        <p>While Longhorn and 10X tried to fix Windows, Project "Midori" tried to replace it entirely. Discover Microsoft's secret research operating system built from scratch using managed code.</p>
    </header>

    <section id="concept" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 1: What was Project Midori?</h2>
        <div class="card-icon midori-icon">🌿</div>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>NOT WINDOWS:</strong> Unlike every other project in this archive, Midori was <strong>not</strong> based on the Windows NT kernel. It had zero code in common with Windows.
        </div>
        <p>
            Incubated deeply within <strong>Microsoft Research</strong> around 2003 (and active until roughly 2015), Midori was an answer to a specific question: <em>"If we could start over today, without worrying about backward compatibility, how would we build an OS?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer was <strong>Safety</strong>. Most OS crashes and security exploits (buffer overflows) come from memory management errors in C and C++. Midori aimed to eliminate these bugs at the architectural level.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="language" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 2: System M# (The Language)</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">⌨️</div>
        <p>You cannot write a safe OS in C++. So, the Midori team created a new programming language, often referred to as <strong>M# (M-Sharp)</strong> or <strong>System C#</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> The language prevented the programmer from making memory mistakes. A program literally could not access memory it didn't own.</li>
            <li><strong>No Garbage Collection Pauses:</strong> Usually, managed languages (like Java or C#) pause the system to clean up memory. Midori used a unique ownership model (similar to how <strong>Rust</strong> works today) to ensure high performance without pauses.</li>
            <li><strong>Singularity:</strong> Midori was the commercial evolution of an earlier academic project called "Singularity," which proved that an OS could run efficiently in managed code.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="architecture" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 3: The Asynchronous Architecture</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">⚡</div>
        <p>Midori was designed for the cloud era, where one application might span across multiple servers.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>"Async Everything":</strong> In Windows, if an app waits for a file to load, it "blocks" a thread. In Midori, the entire OS was asynchronous. Nothing ever blocked. This made the system incredibly lightweight and responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Isolation:</strong> Programs didn't share memory. They communicated by sending small messages to each other. If one part of the system crashed (e.g., the network driver), it was just a "process" that could be restarted instantly without a Blue Screen of Death.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 4: Why it Failed & The Legacy</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🧬</div>
        <p>Midori was technically superior to Windows in almost every way. So why aren't we using it?</p>
        <p>
            <strong>The "Eco-System" Problem:</strong> Moving to Midori would have meant abandoning millions of existing Windows applications. Microsoft concluded that the cost of rewriting the world's software was too high.
        </p>
        <p>However, Midori was stripped for parts, and its DNA is everywhere in modern Microsoft tech:</p>
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Midori Tech</th>
                    <th>Where it lives today</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>M# / System C#</strong></td>
                    <td>The performance improvements for managed code were ported into <strong>.NET Core</strong> and C#. Features like <span class="inline-code">Span&lt;T&gt;</span> (high-performance memory slicing) came directly from Midori.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Async/Await</strong></td>
                    <td>The asynchronous programming model in C# (and subsequently JavaScript/TypeScript) was heavily influenced by the Midori team's work.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Rust Influence</strong></td>
                    <td>Many of the concepts Midori pioneered (memory safety without garbage collection) are now mainstream in the <strong>Rust</strong> programming language, which Microsoft is now adopting for parts of the Windows Kernel.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Midori was the "Formula 1 car" of operating systems. It was too specialized for the street, but the technology developed for it improved the engine of the car we all drive (Windows/.NET).
