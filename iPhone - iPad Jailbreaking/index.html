        <h2>Section 1: What is Jailbreaking?</h2>
        <div class="card-icon jailbreak-icon">🔓</div>
        <p>
            <strong>Jailbreaking</strong> is the process of removing or bypassing the software restrictions imposed by Apple on devices running iOS and iPadOS. In technical terms, it grants the user <strong>root access</strong> (or administrator privileges) to the operating system, which is normally locked down by the manufacturer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This unlocked access allows users to customize the interface, install third-party applications (known as "tweaks") that are not available on the official App Store, and generally gain deeper control over the device's functionality. The most common result of a successful jailbreak is the installation of a third-party app store, such as <span class="inline-code">Cydia</span> or <span class="inline-code">Sileo</span>, which serves as the hub for downloading these custom modifications.
        </p>

        <h2>Section 2: Why Jailbreak? (Benefits)</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🚀</div>
        <p>Users choose to jailbreak their devices for a variety of reasons, primarily centered around freedom and customization that Apple's "walled garden" does not allow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Customization:</strong> Personalize virtually every aspect of your device's interface, including icons, themes, fonts, animations, and control center layouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Install Unauthorized Apps/Tweaks:</strong> Access applications and system modifications that have not been approved by Apple's review process, offering niche tools or expanded functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove Default Apps and Bloatware:</strong> Gain the ability to uninstall stock Apple applications that cannot be removed on a standard device.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance Functionality:</strong> Add features that are not native to iOS, such as advanced multitasking, call recording, or custom gesture controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrier Unlocking:</strong> In some older cases, jailbreaking was used as a step to unlock a device from a specific mobile network carrier.</li>

        <h2>Section 4: Prerequisites and Preparation</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">⚙️</div>
        <p>To prepare your iPhone or iPad for the jailbreak process, ensure you complete the following critical steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Full Device Backup:</strong> Always back up your device's data using iCloud or a computer (iTunes/Finder) before beginning. This is a crucial safety measure in case the process fails or data is lost.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn Off Find My iPhone/iPad:</strong> Navigate to <span class="path">Settings > [Your Name] > Find My > Find My iPhone/iPad</span> and toggle the feature <strong>Off</strong>. You will need to enter your Apple ID password to confirm.</li>
            <li><strong>Sign Out of iCloud:</strong> For some methods, it is recommended to log out of your iCloud account temporarily to prevent potential errors during the installation.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Compatibility:</strong> Confirm that your specific iPhone or iPad model and its currently installed iOS/iPadOS version are supported by the chosen jailbreak tool (e.g., <span class="inline-code">Checkra1n</span>, <span class="inline-code">unc0ver</span>, <span class="inline-code">Palera1n</span>, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Charge Your Device:</strong> Ensure your device is fully charged, or at least above 50%, to prevent power loss during the sensitive jailbreak procedure.</li>
            <li><strong>Necessary Equipment:</strong> Depending on the tool used, you may require a Mac, a Windows PC, a Linux machine, or a USB drive.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Section 5: The Jailbreaking Process Overview (General Steps)</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">➡️</div>
        <p>The jailbreaking method varies greatly depending on your device and iOS version. However, most modern jailbreaks follow a generalized sequence:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download the Jailbreak Tool:</strong> Download the chosen tool (e.g., an <span class="inline-code">IPA</span> file or a computer utility) onto your device or computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Sideload the Application:</strong> If using an on-device method, you typically need to use a tool like <span class="inline-code">AltStore</span> or a similar utility to "sideload" the jailbreak application onto your iPhone/iPad using a computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust the Developer:</strong> Navigate to <span class="path">Settings > General > VPN & Device Management</span> and manually trust the enterprise developer profile associated with the jailbreak app.</li>
            <li><strong>Execute the Jailbreak:</strong> Open the installed app on your device and tap the "Jailbreak" or "Start" button. This phase may require the device to enter a special state, like </strong>DFU Mode</strong> (Device Firmware Update), especially for hardware-exploit jailbreaks like <span class="inline-code">Checkra1n</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Installation of Package Manager:</strong> After the exploit runs, the device will restart, and a new icon—the package manager (like <span class="inline-code">Cydia</span>, <span class="inline-code">Sileo</span>, or <span class="inline-code">Zebra</span>)—will appear on your Home Screen. This is your portal to downloading tweaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Jailbreak Steps:</strong> Open the package manager, allow it to update its sources, and begin exploring the world of custom tweaks and modifications.</li>
        </ol>
