        <h1>Windows Nashville: The Forgotten Update</h1>
        <p>Explore the history of Windows "Nashville," the operating system intended to bridge the gap between Windows 95 and 98. Often rumored as "Windows 96," it pioneered the integration of the web into the desktop.</p>

        <h2>Section 1: What was Project Nashville?</h2>
        <div class="card-icon nashville-icon">🎸</div>
        <p>
            Started in late 1995, <strong>Nashville</strong> was planned as a minor update to Windows 95. While Windows 95 was a massive success, the internet was exploding in popularity, and Microsoft needed to catch up with Netscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            The press and enthusiasts frequently referred to this project as <strong>"Windows 96"</strong>, although Microsoft never officially confirmed this name. It was designed to run on the Windows 95 kernel but completely replace the user shell (the desktop interface).
        </p>

        <h2>Section 2: The "Web-Based" Desktop</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🌐</div>
        <p>Nashville's primary goal was to blur the line between your local hard drive and the internet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Explorer is the Browser:</strong> In Nashville, the file explorer and the web browser were the same application. You could type a local path (<span class="path">C:\MyFiles</span>) or a URL (<span class="path">http://www.microsoft.com</span>) in the same address bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Click Navigation:</strong> To make files act like hyperlinks, Nashville introduced the option to open files with a single click (underlining icon titles when hovered), a feature that persists in Windows today.</li>
            <li><strong>Athena (PIM):</strong> A new "Personal Information Manager" intended to consolidate email, calendar, and contacts into one streamlined application.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="cancel" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 3: Cancellation & Strategy Shift</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🛑</div>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>CHANGE OF PLANS:</strong> Nashville was cancelled as a standalone operating system release in late 1996.
        </div>
        <p>
            Microsoft realized that releasing a whole new OS just for these features would confuse the market so soon after Windows 95. Instead, they decided to unbundle the features:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Internet Explorer 4.0:</strong> The web integration code was packaged into IE 4.0.</li>
            <li><strong>Windows Desktop Update:</strong> When users installed IE 4.0 on Windows 95 (and NT 4.0), it optionally installed the "Windows Desktop Update," which gave them the Nashville-style explorer.</li>
            <li><strong>Windows 98 (Memphis):</strong> The remaining features and kernel updates were pushed to the next major project, codenamed "Memphis," which became Windows 98.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 4: What Survived? (Build 999)</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">📦</div>
        <p>The most famous leaked version is <strong>Build 999</strong>. It feels like a strange hybrid of Windows 95 and Windows 98.</p>

                    <td><strong>"Athena" PIM</strong></td>

                    <td><strong>Active Desktop</strong></td>
                    <td>The ability to put web widgets on the desktop wallpaper debuted here and was a flagship feature of Windows 98 (though it was resource-heavy and rarely used).</td>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> While Windows Nashville was never sold, the codename appeared in the "Add/Remove Programs" list of early Internet Explorer 4.0 betas, identifying itself as "Windows Desktop Update (Nashville)."
