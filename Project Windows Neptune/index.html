        <h1>Windows Neptune: The Lost Link to XP</h1>
        <p>Discover the story of Windows Neptune, the operating system intended to succeed Windows 2000 for consumers. It was meant to be the first "Home Edition" built on the stable NT kernel.</p>

        <h2>Section 1: The Concept (Consumer NT)</h2>
        <div class="card-icon neptune-icon">🔱</div>
        <p>
            In 1999, Microsoft had two separate lines of Windows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows 9x (95/98):</strong> For home users. Unstable, based on MS-DOS, prone to crashes.</li>
            <li><strong>Windows NT (2000):</strong> For businesses. Extremely stable, secure, but hard to use for games and multimedia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Project Neptune</strong> was the ambitious plan to finally kill MS-DOS. It was designed to bring the power and stability of the <strong>Windows 2000 kernel</strong> to home users, adding a friendly interface and easy setup.

        <h2>Section 2: The "Activity Centers"</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🧩</div>
        <p>The most defining visual feature of Neptune was the introduction of <strong>Activity Centers</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Instead of managing files in folders, Neptune experimented with an HTML-based interface (Active Desktop on steroids). It organized tasks into "Centers":
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start Page:</strong> A dashboard showing recent emails, music, and tasks (similar to the Start Screen in Windows 8, years later).</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Center:</strong> A dedicated hub for managing digital cameras and albums.</li>
            <li><strong>Music Center:</strong> An integrated player and organizer for MP3s.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="important">
            <strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> Neptune tried to make the OS feel like a website, utilizing HTML and scripts for the user interface instead of standard Windows forms.
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section id="cancel" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Section 3: The Merger (Birth of XP)</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🤝</div>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>PROJECT CANCELLED:</strong> In early 2000, Microsoft realized that developing two separate NT systems was inefficient.
        </div>
        <p>
            At the time, Microsoft was working on:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Neptune:</strong> Next-gen Consumer OS.</li>
            <li><strong>Odyssey:</strong> Next-gen Business OS (successor to Win 2000).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The teams were merged into a single project codenamed <strong>"Whistler"</strong>. This project combined the consumer-friendliness of Neptune with the corporate features of Odyssey. <strong>Whistler was released in 2001 as Windows XP.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because Neptune wasn't ready in time, Microsoft released <strong>Windows ME</strong> (Millennium Edition) as a stop-gap for home users. ME is infamous for its instability, proving that the move to the NT kernel (Neptune/XP) was necessary.

        <div class="card-icon">🧬</div>
        <p>Only one major build of Neptune leaked to the public: <strong>Build 5111</strong>. Enthusiasts can install it today to see features that later appeared in XP.</p>
