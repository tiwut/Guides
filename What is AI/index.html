        <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Artificial Intelligence. This resource is designed to explain the definitions, underlying technologies, and the impact of AI on the modern world.</p>
    </header>

    <section id="intro" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="card-icon">🧠</div>
        <p>
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. 
            The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>From voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to complex algorithms driving self-driving cars and generative models like ChatGPT, AI is rapidly transforming industries and daily life.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="key-concepts" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Algorithms inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and interpret sensory data.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A specialized form of ML utilizing multi-layered neural networks to solve complex problems like image recognition.</li>
            <li><strong>NLP (Natural Language Processing):</strong> The branch focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="important">
            <strong>Recall:</strong> AI is not a single technology but a constellation of different technologies working together to enable machines to act with varying levels of intelligence.
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section id="getting-started" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Tools & Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To begin developing or experimenting with AI, Python is the standard programming language due to its extensive library support. You will need to set up a valid environment:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
Install essential AI/ML libraries via pip

$ pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
$ pip install tensorflow torch
</code></pre>
<p>Use platforms like <span class="inline-code">Jupyter Notebooks</span> or <span class="inline-code">Google Colab</span> to run your first experiments interactively.</p>

<section id="best-practices" class="guide-section">
        <h2>Ethics & Best Practices</h2>
        <p>As AI becomes more powerful, responsible development is crucial. Follow these guidelines:</p>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Caution:</strong> AI models can be biased based on the data they were trained on. Always validate outputs and ensure data diversity.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Ensure that the decision-making process of the AI is explainable (Explainable AI).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Protect user data and adhere to regulations like GDPR when training models.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Critical decisions made by AI should always have a human-in-the-loop to prevent catastrophic errors.</li>
        </ul>
